# Covid-Safety-Scanner for people
A citizen's safety based application for a complete monitor of the no of people visiting the place the wish to go or a shop so that they can have their own safety measures. At this time the whole world is affected by COVID-19 disaster and hence people are scared of making more and more contact with other people. They can avoid it by staying at home but at least once in a week they need to get to the shops for buying household stuffs and so on. They can still avoid crowds if they get a realtime data of the no of people visiting a shop at a particulat time. They can then visit the shop when the crowd is less hence maintaining social distance. This project is based on the idea of getting a realtime information of the no of people visiting a shop and getting those data to the people who are going to visit that shop. This helps maitaining less crowds at places hence makes a little step in making India Corona Free by minimizing the spread of it.
